# About goals behind JavOC project
JavOC ***[Jav-ok]*** (Java for Open Computers) is a simple implementation of Java Virtual Machine, designed to run on machines from [OpenComputers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/opencomputers) Minecraft mod.

Language - **Lua 5.2**

Project was heavily inspired by Zen1th's JVM - [lukyt](https://github.com/zenith391/lukyt).

## Goals
Since Java Virtual Machine is a colossal piece of software, main goal of the project is not to implement a "real" JVM, but to create an **educational** project to explain to everyone basics of JVM architecture by example. 

It makes very important to make code and documentation very detailed, comprehensive and clear for everyone. Other aspects, such as functionality, speed, effectivness, etc. are **not** the main focus, and, if it will be required, will be sacrificed in order to meet the primary goal
